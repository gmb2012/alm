# I do not tell my employees **WHAT TO DO** and **HOW TO DO IT**

---

## Lead 30 people (Devs & SMs)
## Recruiting
## Personal development
## Peer for architecture on request
## Consulting e.g. for OKRs
## Conferences / Trainings

---

# The right people sit at the right time at the right table

---

# I solve problems

# [fit] Why
# ...my beliefs

---

# [fit] Empowerment

![original](images/touching-the-plasma-ball-lamp-picjumbo-com.jpg)

^ For Teams and also for me
Basis for driving decisions

---

## “Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.” 

## *Oscar Wilde*

![](images/oscalWilde.jpg)

^ Mistakes are okay even more they are important to learn

---

# [fit] Honesty 
# [fit] & 
# [fit] Transparency

![original](images/Invisible_man.jpg)

^ Basis
If something does not work / fit one has to talk about it to fix it
Let people at least know the reasons behind a decision
Example of transparency:
People know where I am => Office monitor
Daily rates of freelancers => knowing the reasons
Setting clear goals but not paying a bonus dependend on the goals

---

# [fit] Flat hierarchy

![original](images/img_3063.jpg)

^ 
hierarchy hinders honesty, transparency and speed => example with architectural proposals

---

# [fit] Authenticity

![original](images/422218_1868502408988_1801956178_n.jpg)

^ I am me
It is okay to be grumpy sometimes
It is okay to to be 100% behind a decision from above
There is a role of HoE but it is filled with me as a person

---

# [fit] Trust

![original](images/010117pow_cliffhanger.png)

^ THe foundation of collaboration
I hire people I trust
Without trust collaboration is not possible
handover => cooperation => collaboration
Bulding trust => find similarities => canon example

---

## “The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.” 

## *Ernest Hemingway*

# [fit] Leap of faith

^ Core task of a supervisor
Has to be done again and again
Right from the start

---

# [fit] ~~Change~~
# [fit] ~~people~~

---

# [fit]B = f(P,E)
^ Behaviour = function(Personality, Environment)

---

# The only one I can change is me

^ Different people have to be treated differently at different points in time

---

# [fit] Escalation

![original](images/ntfgygpurfa-lemuel-butler.jpg)

^ The disciplinary whip is always the last level but sometimes people need to get a straight call by their supervisor

---

# [fit] Empathy

![](images/103H.jpg)

^ Imho the most important skill in interaction with people
In addition the leads hopefully to adapting your way of interaction to your opposite
mastery: level 1 read the feelings, level 2 adjust your behaviour

---

# [fit]vs. Scrum Master


![original](images/batman-v-superman-henry-cavill3.jpg)

^ ONE team
Focus of Scrum Master is the team
ALM's focus are the individuals
Together they work to tackle Company imediments, improvements and agile transformation
But for teams I like to know about conflicts. I will just act if I am asked for help not before. Reason: to be able to defend

---

# [fit] Passion

![original](images/hand-love-heart-by-the-sea-picjumbo-com.jpg)
